Line basics\n- Each line describes one place in the structure.\n- Left side before the colon \":\" – folder path.\n- Right side after the colon – list of files in that path.\n\n2. Folder path\n- Folders are separated with \"/\".\n- First segment is the top‑level folder, next ones are nested.\n- Example: Pro/etc means folder \"Pro\" with \"etc\" inside it.\n\n3. File list\n- Files are separated by commas.\n- Spaces around names are ignored.\n- Example: index.html, main.css\n\n4. Full example\nPro/etc: index.html, main.css\nPro/js: main.js\n\nWhat will this create?\n- Folder \"Pro\".\n- Inside it: folders \"etc\" and \"js\".\n- In \"etc\": index.html, main.css.\n- In \"js\": main.js.\n\nImportant\n- Everything is always created only inside the selected root directory.\n- Attempts to go outside root are ignored (counted as \"Skipped\")."
